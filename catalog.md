Limited knowledge about IT; Capable of using web applications 

Frequency of using the software: 
3 to 5 times per week

Describe what user expects.

1. *Simple management for employees*
    
   Creating an account is a tedious and repetitive work. The workflow to accomplish this task is very similar from time to time except for the differences in personal information. For account deletion, manager has to look up for the related records in multiple linked record tables ( When delete an account from employee list, his sales record table needs to be deactivated as well ). For a **small-scaled** sales company, it would be a remarkable cost to hire extra HR team to take these tasks. It would be a great advantage if the employee management can be simplified and become manageable wants to simplify these two tasks and make them less tedious. 
    
2. *Reliable and secured management of employee information* 
    
    The management of employee information can be challenging in terms of information security. How to keep all the sensitive information without leaking it to outside of company is a serious problem for the manager.  Traditional way of keeping everything on paper is not secured enough: the information can be damaged or leaked out easily. Hence managers expect a more reliable, secured method to manage the employee information. 
    
3. *Effectively evaluate the most updated sales performances*

    By the traditional way supervising sales performances is inefficient. Every time when the manager wants to check some sales representative's performance, he (or the accountant) has to look up for this person's sales records from a large number of rows, and then asks the accountant to add up all sales amount of this person before he can actually sees the sales performance for a single person. The worse part is that the calculated sales result of this person is not real-time, meaning the result does not include changes happen after start of the calculation (time spend can be very long due to slow computation). Hence the manager would be very glad to have a faster, more effective, and more updated sales performances evaluation.
    
Your proposal to solve the object

1. Implement a function in the Solaris application specifically for employee management. Use elegant user interfaces and workflow to simplify the process of adding / removing user accounts:  
- Identity number will be auto-generated and saved 
- Account creation date is current date by default 
- Use input validations where applicable to reduce the chance for errors. For example, check the email format automatically to prevent invalid email address; or check if the employee name is an empty input to prevent absence of information 
- Provide auto-completion where applicable to speed up the process of creating account. For example, use selection menu for the "job title" input field with options of manager, sales, marketing etc. And once an option is selected, the system will fill in the basic salary automatically (assuming for each type of job the basic salary is pre-defined, and if not manager can always amend it manually). 

2. Information of each employee will be stored in the same schema as a data entity with encryption, from where the read / addition / modification / deletion is executed. This mechanism will protect the information from leaking out. 
Each employee will be assigned an account for the use of ONLY himself which is protected by a unique password. This will ensure the privacy of each employee is protected, and make sure they can only access data that belongs to themselves.

3. Utilize report function of Solaris to meet manager's needs for sales performance evaluation: Individual sales person can be targeted easily with a single operation of search (by name / company identity number). His sales amount will be calculated dynamically and shown upon the search request. Manager can view the performance of this person in a second. This is much faster than manually looking up for his records and sum them up, and therefore ensures the up-to-date sales performance evaluation as well. 



### [User B] 

Post/Position:  
Sales Representative (SR)

IT literacy: 
Basic IT knowledge; Able to use web applications

Frequency of using the software: 
Daily

Purpose of using the software: 

1. *Present products, make suggestions and sell products to customers*
2. *collect/ amend / submit / withdraw orders* 
3. *Report sales results to the accounting team*
4. *Track order delivery status*

Situation of using the software: 

1. When sales meet clients for discussion of purchase
    If the client already knows what laptop to purchase, they need to demonstrate laptop information to clients upon request: 
   - laptop name
   - model
   - brand
   - series number
   - dimensions
   - weight
   - battery volume
   - screen size
   - memory size
   - hard disk volume
   - processor model
   - profile images
   - promotions for this laptop
   
   If the customer has no idea about how to choose a laptop, but has some expectations or requirements of the product, sales need to filter out products which satisfy customer's requirements. 
   
   If the customer totally has no ideas what kind of laptop to buy, sales representatives need to make suggestions for the clients based on some standards:
   - price range
   - brand
   - performance
   - appearance
   - featured usage (e.g. gaming laptop, business laptop, portable laptop, etc.) 
   - battery life
   - weight / size

2. When sales representatives finish a deal with clients, they need to submit the deal details back to the company:
    - deal date
    - laptop model sold
    - unit price
    - quantity of purchase
    - customer name
    - customer contact information
  
3. When sales representatives have confirmed an order with the customer, they need to submit the order back to the company for the following activities (such as delivery).
 
4. When there is a change / cancellation on submitted deals (which happened quite often for **small-scaled** companies), sales representatives have to amend the orders or withdraw them. 

5. When an order is confirmed and submitted, the sales representatives still need to track the product delivery to make sure clients can get their laptop on time. 

Describe what user expects.

1. *An easy-to-operate but powerful demonstration to showcase products to customers as detailed as possible*
    
    It is impossible for sales to bring all different models of laptops for the customers to choose. Hence presentation of laptops on a computer screen must be persuasive and convincing enough. The demonstration should be able to provide information of products as detailed as possible, yet not too complicated to operate or to watch. 

2. *Being able to efficiently make recommendations based on various requirements of clients*

    Clients can have all kinds of different requirements about their ideal laptops. At the same time, their only have limited patience. Hence it is hard for sales representatives to quickly find out the product(s) which match the customer needs. If they fail to do so, the business opportunity might be wasted. 

3. *Conveniently submit deals results* 
    
    Due to the nature of the work, sales representatives spend lots of their time working with the clients and often being out of the office. In a traditional manner, when one deal is done, they need to record the details down and go back to the office and report to whoever is managing the deal results. This is very troublesome and inefficient for both the sales and the staff who manages the deal results (Even if sales can report the results via a phone call or an email it still takes much extra time for the staff who manages sale results to process and record all the information). So it is very necessary to have a new way to submit deal results without so much trouble.

4. *Agile and flexible order system which allows modifications and cancellations even after submission* 
    
    As a small-scaled company, one of the advantages our client hold is that they can be flexible on the order processing. There are always customers who regret after the deal has been confirmed. To retain these clients, the sales representatives are expecting an order system which permits modifications or even cancellations after submission. This is difficult to operate manually and very easy to cause mistakes. So sales representatives are need a more robust and agile system to realize this function. 

5. *Easily track the order delivery status* 

    Delivery delay or loss caused by not tracking delivery status after order is confirmed can be a serious problem during the sales. Sales representatives need a more convenient way to check the deliveries whenever they want and wherever they are to make sure the deliveries are on time.


Your proposal to solve the object

1. Create a comprehensive and fully-detailed 'laptop library' to store information of all models of products that the company holds. Design an elegant, user-friendly interface in the application for the showcase to enhance visual effects. Use images of laptops with the actual dimensions to make it more vivid. Quantify the performance and battery life of laptops to give customers a more accurate and straightforward evaluation. 
   
2. Design powerful search functions which filters products by user's preferences such as brand, size, weight, screen size, price range, battery performance, hardware specifications etc. There can be more than one search criteria. On top of that, assign each laptop with one or a few tags which describes the specialized features of the product. For instance, [Gaming Laptop] tag for products with high performance on display effect and game processing; or [Specialized for Girls] tag for laptops which are fancy, light-weighted and easy-to-use. The recommendation function will choose products for target clients based on the filters and tags. If customers do not have any requirements / expectations / preferences about the laptop, the system can still make recommendations based on customer's features such as gender, age, salary, occupation etc.

3. Design a deal submission function for sales representatives. Use elegant user interfaces and workflow to simplify the process of submission. Use input validations and auto-completion where applicable to reduce the chance for errors and increase the efficiency. 

4. Use the order system in our application Solaris, sales representatives can access the submitted orders from remote and do modifications or cancellations. The result will be effective immediately. Submitted orders are stored as it is for at least 24 hours, within which any modifications / cancellations are allowed.  

5. Use the tracking function in the order system of Solaris, sales representatives are able to check the real-time delivery status of any order of his clients. He only needs to enter the order series number, and all the information he needs will be presented, with frequent updates. He can also choose to receive a notification in the application when an order he is in charge of has been safely delivered to the customer.  




### [User C] 
Post/Position:  
After-sales Service Agent (ASA)

IT literacy: 
Medium IT knowledge; Understand basic knowledge about laptop software and hardware  

Frequency of using the software: 
Daily

Purpose of using the software: 

1. *Deal with after-sale service requests of laptop replacement and repair from clients*

Situation of using the software: 

1. When a customer calls service center and asks for replacement / repair of the laptop he purchased, after-sales service agents need to handle the request. He serves as a mediator between customer and the company to provide customers with satisfying after-sales services.  

Describe what user expects.

1. *Conveniently check customer's purchase records and get crucial information like purchased model, purchased date, warranty length etc in time.*
    
    Looking for particular customer's purchase information such as purchased model, purchased date, warranty length from hundreds of different records manually is way to slow for a customer to wait for. The quality of after-sales service will be largely affected by the responding time. Maintenance of all such information is also difficult and troublesome when there is no systematic management for it. Such after-sales services contribute an essential part to the sales performance as customers value it a lot when it comes to laptop purchase. Poor services might bring the company a damaged reputation. Hence after-sales agents need a faster and more convenient way to do this task indeed. 

2. *Easy to track the status of maintenance services* 
    
     After validating after-sales service requests from customers and transferred them to technical staff, the next task on after-sales service agent's shoulders is to keep track of the progress of the service.  However this is not easy. There can be a lot of requests going on at the same time, which come from different clients, involve different products, ask for different services (replacement, return, repair, etc). The whole maintenance service will be extremely messy without a sophisticated management of all these different requests. So the service agents expect a much more easier way to track progress of all different requests, so they can follow up the cases accordingly with order.  

Your proposal to solve the object

1. Use our application Solaris to maintain purchase records and use the after-sales function of Solaris to help the services. The agent can conveniently obtain customer's record within a second by searching it with customer's order number, or name, or contact number.  And the purchased date, warranty length, whether warranty has expired (with a status of YES or NO) will be automatically displayed when the record is been found. Agents can save huge amount of time finding the customer's purchase information, checking with customer about the warranty status, and validating it. It is also so easy to process this service request after the call as it is still within the same application system.  

2. Use the after-sales function of Solaris to do the management of different service requests. When agents receive a new call from a customer, they will simply create a new request in the system for the customer. This request is automatically associated with the customer's order. As the progress of this maintenance request changes, its status in the system will be updated accordingly (e.g. status might vary from 'Pending' to 'Queuing', 'In progress', 'Almost Finished' or 'Ready'). Agents can follow up the status any time they wish with simply a search by the request index or by the name of the customer and update the progress to the customer promptly. They can also check the requests categorized by the status. For example, they can find out which requests are still queuing, then tell the customers to wait; or they can look for 'Almost Finished' requests and inform customers that they can receive the results in a short time. 
  


### [User D] 

Post/Position:  
Accountants (AC)

IT literacy: 
Limited IT knowledge; Able to use accounting software  

Frequency of using the software: 
Daily

Purpose of using the software: 

1. Cost calculation
2. Sales sum up
3. Profit calculation
4. Finance reports production

Situation of using the software: 

1. Accountants have to compute the cost for each deal for the calculation of profit 

2. Accountants have to sum up sales amount for production of finance and sales reports

3. Accountants have to calculate the profits the whole company and each of the sales representatives have made

4. Accountants have to combine all the information above to produce reports to reflect the company's business dynamics. 

Describe what user expects.

1. Faster calculations with less errors:
    
The calculations and summaries are very tedious, easy to make mistakes yet hard to find out the errors. Errors on calculations can cause serious loss for the company. Accountants need some assistants to help them deliver their work with faster speed and higher accuracy. 

2. Efficiently generate diverse reports 

The range of finance reports or sales report vary from time to time, accountants have to process some repetitive data over and over again to produce reports for managers or market analyzers. Again, this work is tedious, and has a high risk for errors. A better tool to generate reports efficiently according to the demands is definitely expected from accountants, because it can increase the efficiency largely and avoid most of the calculation errors. 

Your proposal to solve the object

1. Use the accounting function of Solaris to help accelerate calculations. All the data required such as laptop purchased price, sold price, sales amounts are all entered before in linked data storage,  which saves the time of looking up for all the records to get the data. With several simple operations to specify the scope and goal for calculation, Solaris will present the correct results within seconds. 

2. Use the report function of Solaris to generate reports. Accountants just need to set the type and scope of the report, all the rest will be handled by the application. For example, for monthly sales report of each sales representative, the accountant just need to select "sales report" option, specify the time range to be January, choose "sort by employee name", and click "Generate", an accurate, detailed, comprehensive report will be created in a few seconds. Of course, instead of the standard settings for reports, they can also customized the results to be presented in the report. For example, they can set filter criteria so that the sales report only shows performances of employees who joined the company for less than 3 months. 



### [User E] 

Post/Position: 
Sales Managers (SM)

IT literacy: 
Limited knowledge about IT; Capable of using web applications 

Frequency of using the software: 
Daily

Purpose of using the software: 

1. *Retrieve product information for market analysis*
2. *Retrieve sales performance information for market analysis*
3. *Manage product promotions*

Situation of using the software: 

1. When sales manager want to analyse the market from the perspective of product purchases, he needs to obtain information about the product, such as the current price, historical prices (highest and lowest price, average price etc), and prices change trends between several vendors. Also, he has to know the inventory for the products for the sake of market analysis. 

2. When sales manager want to analyse the market from the perspective of sales performance, he need to obtain sales reports for: the recent total sales situation for the company, the recent total sales for each model of product, the recent sales for each sales representatives, etc. 

3. Sometimes the sales for some products do not perform well. Launching a promotion for these products can stimulate the sales, which is the job of sales managers. 

Describe what user expects.

1. *Access to abundant product information* 
    
    For sales managers, the marketing analysis would be very difficult to proceed if they do not have an easy access to the updated product information. In the current situation, there is no such a system for them to instantly check the historical price records, not to mention comparing which are the highest / lowest prices. They have to took extra time to find the record they want, and they can't detect the price change promptly. So it would be a lot better if they have an easier, faster way to obtain the more updated prices when they need to do marketing analysis. 

2. *Conveniently obtain sales performance reports upon request* 
    
    When sales managers want to study the sales performance of certain product or certain representative, the conventional method of producing sales report is too slow and rigid. Also, he has to go through the complicated workflow with the accountants from request for a sales to report, to wait for sales representatives to submit their deals, to wait for accountants to compute the amounts, to wait for them to produce the sales report, and finally to receive the sales report from the accountants. The whole process is so tedious and time-consuming that it becomes a serious problem for sales managers, especially when they need to analyse newly-updated sales reports frequently. They definitely need a new solution to conveniently obtain sales performance reports upon requests.

3. *Manage promotions and group pricing easily*
    
    Apply promotions to a list of target products, or set different prices for different group of users are common strategies for increasing sales. However these promotions are not easy to operate. It is very easy to miss out some products which are supposed to apply promotions, or to introduce some confusions of multiple promotions to the same product. The product information would also easily become messy if group pricing is not managed well. Sales managers need a more systematic, efficient way to manage these promotions.

Your proposal to solve the object

1. Use the product information storage in the application Solaris to record more data for each product, including: historical price, current price, and current inventory. Also, comparisons for historical highest / lowest prices can be easily retrieved with this function as well. Moreover, a real-time pricing function refreshes frequently to let users know the most recent price for this product. 

2. Authorize the access to sales reports to all sales manager roles. They can obtain all forms of sales reports as fast as accountants. 

3. Use the promotion functionality of Solaris which can apply to selected list of products or customers types. The items in a list can be selected by specifying models, brands, tags or other customized standards. A validation will be gone through to pick out any product in the list with multiple promotions applied. Users can also set the promotion name, valid period, discount amount etc. In a dashboard, sales managers can manage all the active promotions all together. This function will largely relief

### [Merit 3] -- Accurate product recommendations

Product recommendation plays an important part in sales if the recommendation can accurately meet client's requirements. This application supports accurate product recommendations which can finds the most suitable selection for the customer based on their requirements / expectations / preferences (if they have none of the above, the system can still make recommendations based on customer's features such as gender, age, salary, occupation etc).

#### [Function 1: Search with multiple filters]

Such function is critical for the recommendation feature, because when customers have several requirements, the system has to quickly find out the list of products which are qualified. 

**Priority:** High

**Implemented:** N

#### [Function 2: Assign tags to laptops]

**Priority:** Medium

**Implemented:** N


#### [Function 4: Rank recommendations by suitability ]

Due to the blur matching function, there can be more than one recommendation for each customer. Ranking is required to let the customers know which recommendation is the best option.
