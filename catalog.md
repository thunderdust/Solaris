## Chapter 2 - Details of the user profiles
Please provide profile for **ALL** users of your system. 

### [User A] 
Post/Position: General Manager (GM)

IT literacy: 
Limited knowledge about IT; Capable of using web applications 

Frequency of using the software: 
3 to 5 times per week

Purpose of using the software: 

1. *Manage employees*
2. *Supervise and evaluate sales performances*						

Situation of using the software: 

1. When new employee A join the company, GM needs to create an account for him.

2. When sales representative S resigns from the company, GM needs to deactivate S's account

3. When GM wants to check the sales performances of the sales representatives

4. When GM wants to check the market situations 

Describe what user expects.

1. *Simple account management*
    
   Creating new accounts or deactivating accounts are a tedious and repetitive work. GM has limited time for managing employee accounts. So, it would be a great advantage if the employee management can be simplified and become more manageable with less human resources. 
    
2. *Reliable and secured management of employee information* 
    
    The management of employee information can be challenging in terms of information security. How to keep all the sensitive information without leaking it to outside of company is a serious problem for the manager.  Traditional way of keeping everything on paper is not secured enough: the information can be damaged or leaked out easily. Hence managers expect a more reliable, secured method to manage the employee information. 
    
3. *Effectively evaluate the most updated sales performances*

    By the traditional way supervising sales performances is inefficient. Every time when the manager wants to check some sales representative's performance, he (or the accountant) has to look up for this person's sales records from a large number of rows, and then asks the accountant to add up all sales amount of this person before he can actually sees the sales performance for a single person. The worse part is that the calculated sales result of this person is not real-time, meaning the result does not include changes happen after start of the calculation (time spend can be very long due to slow computation). Hence the manager would be very glad to have a faster, more effective, and more updated sales performances evaluation.

4. *Access to comprehensive, profound market information*

    The most important job for GM is to monitor the market and to adjust company strategies accordingly. Hence they really need an easy access to comprehensive, profound market information to help him make business decisions. 

5. *Fast, systematic, accurate employee assessment*
    
    Due to the **limited HR team power** in small-scaled companies, and the **variety of laptops** they sell, it is hard to do employee assessment. What the GM wants is a faster, more accurate assessment system with diverse evaluation criteria. 
    
Your proposal to solve the object

1. Use Solaris function specifically for employee management. Use elegant user interfaces and workflow to simplify the process of adding / removing user accounts.

2. Information of each employee will be stored in the same schema as a data entity with encryption, from where the read / addition / modification / deletion is executed. This mechanism will protect the information from leaking out. 
Each employee will be assigned an account for the use of ONLY himself which is protected by a unique password. This will ensure the privacy of each employee is protected, and make sure they can only access data that belongs to themselves.

3. Utilize report function of Solaris to meet manager's needs for sales performance evaluation: Individual sales person can be targeted easily with a single operation of search (by name / company identity number). His sales amount will be calculated dynamically and shown upon the search request. Manager can view the performance of this person in a second. This is much faster than manually looking up for his records and sum them up, and therefore ensures the up-to-date sales performance evaluation as well. 

4. View the marketing information from the market dashboard in Solaris. See predictions to the upcoming market changes based on the information Solaris collects. 

5. Our application provides the client company with a more sophisticated and efficient assessment solution. All the essential data such as individual sales amount accumulations, average sales per month, total profits produced and so on are computed and shared among many components of the application. This ensures the much more faster speed to retrieve necessary data when doing employee assessment compared to the conventional manual method. Solaris adopts a diversity of standards to evaluate employee performances, and takes the **special properties of laptops** (e.g. sales differences between different models or even brands, high order cancel rates) into account to make assessment more fair and accurate. 

### [User B] 

Post/Position:  
Sales Representative (SR)

IT literacy: 
Basic IT knowledge; Able to use web applications

Frequency of using the software: 
Daily

Purpose of using the software: 

1. *Sell products to customers*
2. *collect/ amend / submit / withdraw orders* 
3. *Report sales results to the accounting team*
4. *Track order delivery status*
5. *Receive laptop sales training*

Situation of using the software: 

1. When sales meet clients for discussion of purchase
    If the client already knows what laptop to purchase, they need to demonstrate laptop information to clients upon request: 
   - laptop name
   - model
   - brand
   - series number
   - dimensions
   - weight
   - battery volume
   - screen size
   - memory size
   - hard disk volume
   - processor model
   - profile images
   - promotions for this laptop
   
   If the customer has no idea about how to choose a laptop, but has some expectations or requirements of the product, sales need to filter out products which satisfy customer's requirements. 
   
   If the customer totally has no ideas what kind of laptop to buy, sales representatives need to make suggestions for the clients based on some standards:
   - price range
   - brand
   - performance
   - appearance
   - featured usage (e.g. gaming laptop, business laptop, portable laptop, etc.) 
   - battery life
   - weight / size

2. When sales representatives finish a deal with clients, they need to submit the deal details back to the company:
    - deal date
    - laptop model sold
    - unit price
    - quantity of purchase
    - customer name
    - customer contact information
  
3. When sales representatives have confirmed an order with the customer, they need to submit the order back to the company for the following activities (such as delivery).
 
4. When there is a change / cancellation on submitted deals, sales representatives have to amend the orders or withdraw them. 

5. When an order is confirmed and submitted, the sales representatives still need to track the product delivery to make sure clients can get their laptop on time. 

6. When a employee newly joins the company as a sales representative, he needs to go through related training before he starts to sell laptops.  

Describe what user expects.

1. *An easy-to-operate but powerful demonstration to showcase products to customers as detailed as possible*
    
    It is impossible for sales to bring all different models of laptops for the customers to choose. Hence presentation of laptops on a computer screen must be persuasive and convincing enough. The demonstration should be able to provide information of products as detailed as possible, yet not too complicated to operate or to watch. 

2. *Being able to efficiently make recommendations based on various requirements of clients*

    Clients can have all kinds of different requirements about their ideal laptops. At the same time, their only have limited patience. Hence it is hard for sales representatives to quickly find out the product(s) which match the customer needs. If they fail to do so, the business opportunity might be wasted. 

3. *Easy way to check additional services such as warranty and add-ons*

    A special property of laptop sales is that sales representatives have to deal with all **various additional services**. For instance, this laptop provides 2 years of warranty, but there is no build-in anti-virus software for the purchase. Meanwhile another laptop only has 6 months warranty, but provides a totally free office software suite included in the purchase. These additional services attract customers and convince them to buy the products. But these services are so different from one product to another, making sales representatives so confused that it can affect his sales success rate. They need a more clear, easy check on these additional services for all the products, so they can handle all different customer questions. 

4. *Conveniently submit deals results* 
    
    Sales representatives spend lots of their time working with the clients and often being out of the office. In a traditional manner, when one deal is done, they need to record the details down and go back to the office and report to whoever is managing the deal results. This is very troublesome and inefficient for both the sales and the staff who manages the deal results (Even if sales can report the results via a phone call or an email it still takes much extra time for the staff who manages sale results to process and record all the information). So it is very necessary to have a new way to submit deal results without so much trouble.

5. *Agile and flexible order system which allows modifications and cancellations even after submission* 
    
    As a small-scaled company, one of the drawbacks is the **instability of business**. There are more individual customers, and they can change their minds after the deal has been confirmed more easily. To increase competitive strength and retain customers, an order mechanism which permits modifications or even cancellations after deal submission is needed. This is difficult to operate and very easy to cause mistakes. So they need a more agile system to implement this function. 

6. *Easily track the order delivery status* 

    Delivery delay or loss caused by not tracking delivery status after order is confirmed can be a serious problem during the sales. Sales representatives need a more convenient way to check the deliveries whenever they want and wherever they are to make sure the deliveries are on time.

7. *Complete, professional training*

     Sales in a laptop selling company is different from other sales. They have to own adequate **IT backgrounds** and strong **knowledge about laptop specifications**. However new joiners can seldom receive enough training to help them equip themselves with the essential professional skills. This is a problem especially for small-scaled companies who do not have training resources. A complete, professional IT&sales training for employees is indeed necessary for the sales representatives. 


Your proposal to solve the object

1. Create a comprehensive and fully-detailed 'laptop library' to store information of all models of products that the company holds. Design an elegant, user-friendly interface in the application for the showcase to enhance visual effects. Use images of laptops with the actual dimensions to make it more vivid. Quantify the performance and battery life of laptops to give customers a more accurate and straightforward evaluation. 
   
2. Design powerful search functions which filters products by user's preferences such as brand, size, weight, screen size, price range, battery performance, hardware specifications etc. There can be more than one search criteria. On top of that, assign each laptop with one or a few tags which describes the specialised features of the product. For instance, [Gaming Laptop] tag for products with high performance on display effect and game processing; or [Specialised for Girls] tag for laptops which are fancy, light-weighted and easy-to-use. The recommendation function will choose products for target clients based on the filters and tags. If customers do not have any requirements / expectations / preferences about the laptop, the system can still make recommendations based on customer's features such as gender, age, salary, occupation etc.

3. Use our application Solaris to check all the add-on services such as warranty, anti-virus packages, office software suites and additional gifts uniformly. 

4. Design a deal submission function for sales representatives. Use elegant user interfaces and workflow to simplify the process of submission. Use input validations and auto-completion where applicable to reduce the chance for errors and increase the efficiency. 

5. Use the order system in our application Solaris, sales representatives can access the submitted orders from remote and do modifications or cancellations. The result will be effective immediately. Submitted orders are stored as it is for at least 24 hours, within which any modifications / cancellations are allowed.  

6. Use the tracking function in the order system of Solaris, sales representatives are able to check the real-time delivery status of any order of his clients. He only needs to enter the order series number, and all the information he needs will be presented, with frequent updates. He can also choose to receive a notification in the application when an order he is in charge of has been safely delivered to the customer.  

7. Use the training system of Solaris to help fresh sales representatives obtain professional knowledge required. The training includes sales training, general IT knowledge training, and laptop knowledge training. The grades of training can be used as an index for evaluating new employees as well.  




### [User C] 
Post/Position:  
After-sales Service Agent (ASA)

IT literacy: 
Medium IT knowledge; Understand basic knowledge about laptop software and hardware  

Frequency of using the software: 
Daily

Purpose of using the software: 

1. *Deal with after-sale service requests of laptop replacement / repair from clients*
2. *Collect customers' feedback on after-sales services*

Situation of using the software: 

1. When a customer calls / emails service center and asks for replacement / repair of the laptop he purchased, after-sales service agents need to handle the request. He serves as a mediator between customer and the company to provide customers with satisfying after-sales services.  

2. When a after-sale service has been processed, the agent needs to collect customer's feedback on the service to help improve it in future. He might ask the customers a few questions, or ask the customer to rate the service. 

Describe what user expects.

1. *Conveniently check customer's purchase records and get after-sales service information*
    
    Looking for particular customer's purchase information such as purchased model, purchased date, warranty length from hundreds of different records manually is way to slow for a customer to wait for. The quality of after-sales service will be largely affected by the responding time. Maintenance of all such information is also difficult and troublesome when there is no systematic management for it. Such after-sales services contribute an essential part to the sales performance as customers value it a lot when it comes to laptop purchase. Poor services might bring the company a damaged reputation. Hence after-sales agents need a faster and more convenient way to do this task indeed. 

2. *Easy to track the status of maintenance services* 
    
     After validating after-sales service requests from customers and transferred them to tech staff, the next task on after-sales service agent's shoulders is to keep track of the progress of the service.  However this is not easy. There can be a lot of requests going on at the same time, which come from different clients, involve different products, ask for different services (replacement, return, repair, etc). The whole maintenance service will be extremely messy without a sophisticated management of all these different requests. So the service agents expect a much more easier way to track progress of all different requests, so they can follow up the cases accordingly with order.  

3. *Effectively collect customers feedback*
    
    Traditional of asking feedback from customers is inefficient and low-response. Many customers do not have the patience to spend extra time on feedback surveys. It is also a burden for service agents to keep asking for feedback from numerous customers. Hence the agents need a more effective tool to help them do this task. 

Your proposal to solve the object

1. Use our application Solaris to maintain purchase records and use the after-sales function of Solaris to help the services. The agent can conveniently obtain customer's record within a second by searching it with customer's order number, or name, or contact number.  And the purchased date, warranty length, whether warranty has expired (with a status of YES or NO) will be automatically displayed when the record is been found. Agents can save huge amount of time finding the customer's purchase information, checking with customer about the warranty status, and validating it. It is also so easy to process this service request after the call as it is still within the same application system.  

2. Use the after-sales function of Solaris to do the management of different service requests. Upon receiving new customer request, agents will simply create a new request in the system based on the order number so it is automatically associated with the customer's order. Agents can follow up the status of requests any time they wish with simply a search by the request number or by the name of the customer and update the progress to the customer promptly. 

3. Use the after-sales function of Solaris to handle the service feedback task. Every time when a after-sale service is done, Solaris will automatically send a simple survey to the customer's email address (which can be found in customer data shared within Solaris system components). Customer's response will be recorded into the system automatically. Even if they ignore the email, system will also record their response as 'Not responding'.
  


### [User D] 

Post/Position:  
Accountants (AC)

IT literacy: 
Limited IT knowledge; Able to use accounting software  

Frequency of using the software: 
Daily

Purpose of using the software: 

1. Cost calculation
2. Sales sum up
3. Profit calculation
4. Reports production

Situation of using the software: 

1. Accountants have to compute the cost for each deal for the calculation of profit 

2. Accountants have to sum up sales amount for production of finance and sales reports

3. Accountants have to calculate the profits the whole company and each of the sales representatives have made

4. Accountants have to combine all the information above to produce reports to reflect the company's business dynamics, and to provide indication of employee performances. 

Describe what user expects.

1. Faster calculations with less errors:
    
    The calculations and summaries are very tedious, easy to make mistakes yet hard to find out the errors. Errors on calculations can cause serious loss for the company. Accountants need some assistants to help them deliver their work with faster speed and higher accuracy. 

2. Efficiently generate diverse reports 

    The range of finance reports or sales report vary from time to time, accountants have to process some repetitive data over and over again to produce reports for managers or market analyzers. Again, this work is tedious, and has a high error rate. A better tool to generate reports efficiently according to the demands is definitely expected from accountants, because it can increase the efficiency largely and avoid most of the calculation errors. 

Your proposal to solve the object

1. Use the accounting function of Solaris to help accelerate calculations. All the data required such as laptop purchased price, sold price, sales amounts are all entered before in linked data storage,  which saves the time of looking up for all the records to get the data. With several simple operations to specify the scope and goal for calculation, Solaris will present the correct results within seconds. 

2. Use the report function of Solaris to generate reports. Accountants just need to set the type and scope of the report, all the rest will be handled by the application. For example, for monthly sales report of each sales representative, the accountant just need to select "sales report" option, specify the time range to be say January, choose "sort by employee name", and click "Generate", an accurate, detailed, comprehensive report will be created in a few seconds. Of course, instead of the standard settings for reports, they can also customized the results to be presented in the report. For example, they can set filter criteria so that the sales report only shows performances of employees who joined the company for less than 3 months. 



### [User E] 

Post/Position: 
Sales Managers (SM)

IT literacy: 
Limited knowledge about IT; Capable of using web applications 

Frequency of using the software: 
Daily

Purpose of using the software: 

1. *Retrieve product information for market analysis*
2. *Retrieve sales performance information for market analysis*
3. *Manage product promotions*
4. *Manage sales representatives (training, guiding, setting targets)*
5. *Find potential customers and business opportunities* 

Situation of using the software: 

1. When sales manager want to analyse the market from the perspective of product purchases, he needs to obtain information about the product, such as the current price, historical prices (highest and lowest price, average price etc),  prices change trends between several vendors, and the current inventory etc. 

2. When sales manager want to analyse the market from the perspective of sales performance, he need to obtain sales reports for: the recent total sales for the company, the recent total sales for each model of product, the recent sales for each sales representatives, etc. 

3. Sometimes the sales for some products do not perform well. Launching a promotion for these products can stimulate the sales, which is the job of sales managers. 

4. It is also the job of sales managers to give guidance and training to sales representatives. They also need to set sales target for each representative at the beginning of a month. 

5. Sales managers also need to look for new customers and new business opportunities to help the company grow.  

Describe what user expects.

1. *Access to abundant product information* 
    
    For sales managers, the marketing analysis would be very difficult to proceed if they do not have an easy access to the updated product information. In the current situation, there is no such a system for them to instantly check the historical price records, not to mention comparing which are the highest / lowest prices. They have to took extra time to find the record they want, and they can't detect the price change promptly. So it would be a lot better if they have an easier, faster way to obtain the more updated prices when they need to do marketing analysis. 

2. *Obtain sales performance reports quickly and conveniently* 
    
    When sales managers want to study the sales performance of certain product or certain representative, the conventional method of producing sales report is too slow and rigid. Also, he has to go through the complicated workflow with the accountants from request for a sales to report, to wait for sales representatives to submit their deals, to wait for accountants to compute the amounts, to wait for them to produce the sales report, and finally to receive the sales report from the accountants. The whole process is so tedious and time-consuming that it becomes a serious problem for sales managers, especially when they need to analyse newly-updated sales reports frequently. They definitely need a new solution to conveniently obtain sales performance reports upon requests.

3. *Manage promotions and group pricing easily*
    
    Apply promotions to a list of target products, or set different prices for different group of users are common strategies for increasing sales. However these promotions are not easy to operate. It is very easy to miss out some products which are supposed to apply promotions, or to introduce some confusions of multiple promotions to the same product. The product information would also easily become messy if group pricing is not managed well. Sales managers need a more systematic, efficient way to manage these promotions.

4. *Guide and train fresh sales representatives efficiently*

     For small-scaled companies, it is hard to have a specific HR team focus on training new employees and guiding them into their jobs. It is not possible for a sales manager to train everyone by himself either. However, guidance and training are crucial for increasing sales abilities of the employees, especially for laptop sales, which requires both **general sales skills and IT knowledge**. Due to the **inadequate training resources**, sales managers in our target client companies need a more efficient helper to give guidance and training to new employees.

5. "Set targets for employees diversely and flexibly"

    For *laptop selling business*, evaluating performances simply by sales amount is not accurate. There are too many **different laptop models**, each of them has different popularity and makes different profit per unit. Due to this diversity, setting targets for sales staff is hard and complicated. Sales managers have to set targets and evaluate sales staffs according to their experiences and the products they are selling. This is tedious and hard to quantify. Sales managers definitely wish to do this more diversely and flexibly, with a convenient way. 

6. *Find valuable new customers and opportunities efficiently*  
    
    It is not enough to just keep current partners and customers. Sales manager need to look for new opportunities, yet it is not an easy job. Finding new customers and chances that are really valuable to the company efficiently is what sales managers expect.  

Your proposal to solve the object

1. Use the product information storage in the application Solaris to record more data for each product, including: historical price, current price, and current inventory. Also, comparisons for historical highest / lowest prices can be easily retrieved with this function as well. Moreover, a real-time pricing function refreshes frequently to let users know the most recent price for this product. 

2. Authorize the access to sales reports to all sales manager roles. They can obtain all forms of sales reports as fast as accountants. 

3. Use the promotion functionality of Solaris which can apply to selected list of products or customers types. The items in a list can be selected by specifying models, brands, tags or other customized standards. A validation will be gone through to pick out any product in the list with multiple promotions applied. Users can also set the promotion name, valid period, discount amount etc. In a dashboard, sales managers can manage all the active promotions all together. 

4. Use the training system of Solaris to accomplish training goals. The training contains sales strategies and skills, basic IT knowledge such as software/hardware, operating systems, networking, security, anti-virus, laptop knowledge such as the meaning of all the hardware specifications like processor, screen, keyboard, motherboard, display card, hard disk and so on. There is also an assessment function to test how much employee has learned after the training. 

5. Use the employee management function of Solaris to assist target setting. Solaris will automatically compute a default target which is customized for every single employee based on his role, experience, starting salary, the laptop brands / models he sells, his results in training assessment etc. This mechanism provides a more flexible and fair target setting process for employees of various situations.    

6. Use the market dashboard of Solaris to seek for new customers. The dashboard shows all kinds of marketing news, including upcoming IT events or exhibitions where there are lots of potential customers. From the dashboard sales managers can also see newly opened electronics retailers such as Challenger and Courts who possibly need new laptop providers.

## Chapter 3 - Descriptions of each "Merit"

### [Merit 1] --  Employment management designed for small laptop selling company

Our target clients are small-scaled laptop selling business firms. Due to the **limited HR team power**, and the **variety of laptops** they sell (price, sales amount and profit of different laptops vary a lot from each other, which are vogue, brutal standards to evaluate sale representatives' performances), traditional way of assessing employees simply by sales amount is *not efficient* (it takes too much time to count all the sales statistics before the manager can evaluate employees) and *not accurate* (some laptops are easier to sell, some laptops have low sales amount but each order produces more profits, it is hard to tell which indicates a better sales performance). It is a hard job to assess and evaluate sales performances of employees. 

Moreover, for our clients, there are **frequent personnel changes** due to the company instability. Employee management becomes difficult due to frequent creation / deactivation of accounts. There is not enough human resources to take the work as small-scaled companies have limited number of employees (<50 people). It would be a remarkable cost to hire extra HR team to take care of these tasks as well. 

So, it would be a great advantage if the employee management can be simplified and become more manageable with less human resources. One valuable merit of our application is that it eases the management, saves time and money cost for our clients by:
 
1. semi-automatic account creation 
2. semi-automatic account deactivation
3. flexible employee target setting 
4. accurate employee performance assessment

#### [Function 1: Create employee account]

The targets generated by Solaris for each employee is customized for this particular employee himself and try to be as fair as possible. The evaluation scheme is **customized for laptop sales**. If manager has different ideas about the target from the default target given by Solaris, he can still adjust it manually.

#### [Function 4: Assess employee performance ]

Solaris provides accurate, objective assessment on employee performances with this function. Evaluation will take many factors into account, such as sales amount, achieved percentage of target amount. The assessment system also considers for the special properties only appeared in **laptop sale business**. For example, the system assigns different 'performance weights' for selling different laptops because the popularity and the profit of selling one unit are different. Another instance is that the system also considers the frequency of receiving after-sales complains / requests when evaluating sales performances, because compared to other products selling laptop has a **higher after-sales service frequency**. Also, for the new sales employees, their **IT knowledge training test result** is also a factor for assessment in the first few evaluations. 

The workflow of using this function is simple:

Goal: 
Assess sales representative Ray's performance on March, 2016

Steps:

1. Launch Solaris
2. Go to 'Sales Management' tab

### [Merit 4] -- Accurate laptop search & recommendations

Product recommendation plays an important part in sales if the recommendation can accurately meet client's requirements. This is especially true for **laptop sales**, where most of the customers know little about the technical specifications of the product they are going to purchase. Solaris supports accurate laptop recommendations which can finds the most suitable selection for the customer based on their requirements / expectations / preferences (if they have none of the above, the system can still make recommendations based on customer's features such as gender, age, salary, occupation etc).

#### [Function 1: Search with multiple filters]

Such function is critical for the recommendation feature, because when customers have several requirements, the system has to quickly find out the list of products which are qualified. 
Solaris supports search filters for the laptop specifications below:

   - laptop name
   - model
   - brand
   - series number
   - dimensions
   - weight
   - battery volume
   - screen size
   - memory
   - hard disk
   - processor model

Setting price range is also a supported search criteria. 
Search by **laptop tags** is also supported. Function 2 below will explain about tags. 
In the product demonstration interface, sales representatives can apply any number of filters above to find the exact match for customers.  

**Priority:** Medium 

**Implemented:** N

#### [Function 2: Assign tags to laptops]

Tags is a search property specially designed for the laptop recommendation function. They describe the special features or merits of a laptop, which are used to quickly classify all various laptops. For instance, [Gaming Laptop] tag for products with high performance on display effect and game processing; or [For Girls] tag for laptops which are fancy, light-weighted and easy-to-use; or [Business Laptop] tag for laptops specially designed for office usages, with high security protections and business designs.

**Priority:** Low

**Implemented:** N


#### [Function 3: Blur Matching ]

It is almost impossible to find an ideal recommendation that matches all search filters. As long as the major expectations of customer are met by the search results, they can be a good recommendations. Blur matching permits products which do not fully satisfy all criteria to become a recommendation. However it still requires 80% of the search filters are matched.
Aside from the 80% rule, Solaris also supports selecting some filters as compulsory matches. That means, these filters have to be matched even with blur matching scheme. All other laptops do not match these compulsory filters will not be shown in the recommendation results even if they meet 80% of search filters. This scheme helps increase the accuracy of matching results.

< Use Case 1 >
- Sales representative S meets with his client and talks about the laptop that the client wants
- According to the description of the client, S summarises 5 search filters for the laptop that the client expects: 

1. weight <= 2.5kg
2. the brand has to be DELL or Lenovo
3. screen size must be bigger than 13'
4. price <= 1000 SGD
5. memory must be larger than 3GB

After applying filters above, blur matching will function so that any laptops meets at least 4 requirements above will be shown in the results.  

< Use Case 2 >
- Sales representative M meets with his client and talks about the laptop that the client wants
- According to the description of the client, M summarises 5 search filters for the laptop that the client expects: 

1. weight <= 2.5kg
2. Battery life >= 5 hours
3. screen size <= 13'
4. price <= 850 SGD
5. hard disk volume >= 500GB

Among these 5 criteria, the customer insists that price <= 850 SGD is the compulsory match filter. After applying filters above, and setting 'price <= 850 SGD' as compulsory, result only shows laptops with price <= 850 SGD, **and** match at least 4 of the filters above (including price <= 850 SGD). 

 
**Priority:** Medium

**Implemented:** N


#### [Function 4: Recommendation without requirements ]

The three previous functions are based on the assumption that customers have some ideas about the laptop they are going to buy, either some requirements or some expectations. But sometimes customers just totally have **no idea** about how to make a choice. In this case, the system can still make recommendations based on customer's features such as gender, age, salary, occupation etc. 

How to use: 
Key in the customer features: gender, age, occupation, salary of the customer and click the 'Auto-recommend' function button. Some recommendations aligns with these features will be presented in Solaris.
