Describe what user expects.

1. Effortlessly add / remove employee accounts
    
    Create or remove accounts of employees can be troublesome. As described above, to create an account is a tedious and repetitive work. The workflow to accomplish this task is very similar from time to time except for the differences in personal information. As for deletion of accounts, manager has to look up for the related records in multiple linked record tables ( When delete an account from employee list, his sales record table needs to be deactivated as well ). Therefore user wants to simplify these two tasks and make them less tedious. 
    
2. Reliable and secured management of employee information 
    
    The management of employee information can be challenging in terms of information security. How to keep all the sensitive information without leaking it to outside of company is a serious challenging for the manager.  Traditional way of keeping everything on paper is not secured enough: the information can be damaged or leaked out easily. User expects a more reliable, secured method to manage the employee information. 
    
3. Convenient and up-to-date way to check sales performances

    By the traditional way supervising sales performances is inefficient. Every time when the manager wants to check some sales representative's performance, he has to look up for this person's sales records from a large number of rows, and then asks the accountant to add up all sales amount of this person before he can actually sees the sales performance. This is slow, inefficient and very inconvenient. The worse part is that the calculated sales result of this person is not real-time, meaning the result does not include deals of this person submitted after the start of the calculation (This could happen because the time spend from start looking up for the sales person's records to finally obtain the sales amount can be very long). Hence the manager would be very glad to have a faster mechanism to check the up-to-date sales performances.
    
Your proposal to solve the object

1. Implement a function in the Solaris application specifically for employee management. Use elegant user interfaces and workflow to simplify the process of adding / removing user accounts:  
- Identity number will be auto-generated and saved 
- Account creation date is current date by default 
- Use input validations where applicable to reduce the chance for errors. For example, check the email format automatically to prevent invalid email address; or check if the employee name is an empty input to prevent absence of information 
- Provide auto-completion where applicable to speed up the process of creating account. For example, use selection menu for the "job title" input field with options of manager, sales, marketing etc. And once an option is selected, the system will fill in the basic salary automatically (assuming for each type of job the basic salary is pre-defined, and if not manager can always amend it manually). 

2. Information of each employee will be stored in the same schema as a data entity with encryption, from where the read / addition / modification / deletion is executed. This mechanism will protect the information from leaking out. 
Each employee will be assigned an account for the use of ONLY himself which is protected by a unique password. This will ensure the privacy of each employee is protected, and make sure they can only access data that belongs to themselves.

3. Build sales report function to meet manager's requirement of sales performance supervision: Individual sales person can be located easily with a single operation of search (by name or company identity number), and his sales amount will be calculated dynamically upon the search request. This is much faster than manually looking up for his records and sum them up, and therefore achieves up-to-date sales performance check as well. 


### [User B] 
Post/Position:  
Sales Representative

IT literacy: 
Basic IT knowledge; Able to use web appplications

Frequency of using the software: 
Daily

Purpose of using the software: 

1. Present products, make suggestions and sell products to customers
2. Report sales results to the company

Situation of using the software: 

1. When sales meet clients for discussion of purchase
    If the client already knows what laptop to purchase, they need to demonstrate laptop information to clients upon request: 
   - laptop name
   - model
   - brand
   - series number
   - dimensions
   - weight
   - battery volume
   - screen size
   - memory size
   - hard disk volume
   - processor model
   - profile images
   - promotions for this laptop
   
   If the customer has no idea about how to choose a laptop, but has some expectations or requirements of the product, sales need to filter out products which satisfy customer's requirements. 
   
   If the customer totally has no ideas what kind of laptop to buy, sales representatives need to make suggestions for the clients based on some standards:
   - price range
   - brand
   - performance
   - appearance
   - featured usage (e.g. gaming laptop, business laptop, portable laptop, etc.) 
   - battery life
   - weight / size

2. When sales representatives finish a deal with clients, they need to submit the deal details back to the company:
    - deal date
    - laptop model sold
    - unit price
    - quantity of purchase
    - customer name
    - customer contact information

Describe what user expects.

1. An easy-to-operate but powerful demonstration to showcase products to customers as detailed as possible
    
    It is impossible for sales to bring all different models of laptops for the customers to choose. Hence presentation of laptops on a computer screen must be persuasive and convincing enough. The demonstration should be able to provide information of products as detailed as possible, yet not too complicated to operate or to watch. 

2. Being able to efficiently make recommendations based on various requirements of clients

    Clients can have all kinds of different requirements about their ideal laptops. At the same time, their only have limited patience. Hence it is hard for sales representatives to quickly find out the product(s) which match the customer needs. If they fail to do so, the business opportunity might be wasted. 

3. Conveniently submit deals results 
    
    Due to the nature of the work, sales representatives spend lots of their time working with the clients and often being out of the office. In a traditional manner, when one deal is done, they need to record the details down and go back to the office and report to whoever is managing the deal results. This is very troublesome and inefficient for both the sales and the staff who manages the deal results (Even if sales can report the results via a phone call or an email it still takes much extra time for the staff who manages sale results to process and record all the information). So it is very necessary to have a new way to submit deal results without so much trouble.

Your proposal to solve the object

1. Create a comprehensive and fully-detailed 'laptop library' to store information of all models of products that the company holds. Design an elegant, user-friendly interface in the application for the showcase to enhance visual effects. Use images of laptops with the actual dimensions to make it more vivid. Quantify the performance and battery life of laptops to give customers a more accurate and straightforward evaluation. 
   
2. Design powerful search functions which filters products by user's preferences such as brand, size, weight, screen size, price range, battery performance, hardware specifications etc. There can be more than one search criteria. On top of that, assign each laptop with one or a few tags which describes the specialized features of the product. For instance, [Gaming Laptop] tag for products with high performance on display effect and game processing; or [Specialized for Girls] tag for laptops which are fancy, light-weighted and easy-to-use. The recommendation function will choose products for target clients based on the filters and tags. If customers do not have any requirements / expectations / preferences about the laptop, the system can still make recommendations based on customer's features such as gender, age, salary, occupation etc.

3. Design a deal submission function for sales representatives. Use elegant user interfaces and workflow to simplify the process of submission. Use input validations and auto-completion where applicable to reduce the chance for errors and increase the efficiency. 

### [User C] 
Post/Position: 
Marketing Executive

IT literacy: 
Limited knowledge about IT; Capable of using web applications 

Frequency of using the software: 
Daily

Purpose of using the software: 

1. Analyze sales performances 
2. Update product list 
3. Manage product promotions.

Situation of using the software: 

1. Marketing executives need to analyse the sales performances, and combine the analysis with their observations about the marketing trends to come up with new marketing decisions for the future business growth of the company. 

2. When there is a need to discard some products due to bad sales performance or vanishing market demands, marketing executives need to remove the product from the 'laptop library'. Similarly, when they make a decision to introduce new products based on marketing analysis, they need to add the target laptop into the library as well. 

3. Sometimes the sales for some products do not perform well. Launching a promotion for these products can stimulate the sales, which is the job of marketing executives. 

Describe what user expects.

1. Easy access to up-to-date sales performances reports
    
    The marketing analysis would be very difficult to proceed if marketing executives do not have an easy access to the updated sales performances report whenever they want. The access to sales report will become a bottleneck to restrict marketing executives' job.

2. Convenient and simple operations for updating product list

3. Launch promotions and apply them to list of products conveniently and error-freely
    
    Apply promotions to a list of target products manually is repetitive and tedious. It is also very easy to miss out some products which are supposed to apply promotions, or to introduce some confusions if the marketing executives mistakenly apply multiple promotions to the same product. Marketing executives need a more systematic, efficient way to manage these promotions.

Your proposal to solve the object

1. Authorize the access to sales reports to all marketing executive roles. When marketing executives logs into the system with their own account, they have the sales report sections displayed by default. 

2. Design a function specifically for product management. Use elegant user interfaces and workflow to simplify the process of adding / removing products. Use input validations and auto-completion where applicable to reduce the chance for errors and increase the efficiency.

3. Build promotion functionality which can apply to selected list of products. The items in a list can be selected by specifying models, brands, tags or other customized standards. A validation will be gone through to pick out any product in the list with multiple promotions applied. Users can also set the promotion name, valid period, discount amount etc.

### [Merit 3] -- Accurate product recommendations

Product recommendation plays an important part in sales if the recommendation can accurately meet client's requirements. This application supports accurate product recommendations which can finds the most suitable selection for the customer based on their requirements / expectations / preferences (if they have none of the above, the system can still make recommendations based on customer's features such as gender, age, salary, occupation etc).

#### [Function 1: Search with multiple filters]

Such function is critical for the recommendation feature, because when customers have several requirements, the system has to quickly find out the list of products which are qualified. 

**Priority:** High

**Implemented:** N

#### [Function 2: Assign tags to laptops]

Assign tags that describe the features or merits of a laptop, such as [gaming laptop] or [business laptop] or [ultra notebook], etc. Then tags become a recommendation criteria. 

**Priority:** Low

**Implemented:** N


#### [Function 3: Blur Matching ]

It is almost impossible to find an ideal recommendation that matches all requirements from the customer. As long as the major expectations are met by the recommendation, it can be a good match. Blur matching permits products which do not fully satisfy all criteria to become a recommendation.    

**Priority:** Medium

**Implemented:** N


#### [Function 4: Rank recommendations by suitability ]

Due to the blur matching function, there can be more than one recommendation for each customer. Ranking is required to let the customers know which recommendation is the best option. Intuitively, ranking the results by the degree to which the recommendation matches customer's requirements is the most rational method. 

**Priority:** Medium

**Implemented:** N
