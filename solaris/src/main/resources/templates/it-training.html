							<em><b>Information technology (IT)</b></em> is the application of computers to store, retrieve, 
							transmit and manipulate data, often in the context of a business or other enterprise. IT is 
							considered a subset of information and communications technology (ICT). In 2012, Zuppo proposed 
							an ICT hierarchy where each hierarchy level "contain some degree of commonality in that they are 
							related to technologies that facilitate the transfer of information and various types of electronically 
							mediated communications." Business/IT was one level of the ICT hierarchy.<br/>
							In our business's context, we will mainly learn the laptop specifications from this training session. 
							The following aspects will be covered shortly:<br/>

						<p>
						    A computer monitor or a computer display is an electronic visual display for computers. 
						    A monitor usually comprises the display device, circuitry, casing, and power supply. 
						    The display device in modern monitors is typically a thin film transistor liquid crystal 
						    display (TFT-LCD) or a flat panel LED display, while older monitors used a cathode ray 
						    tubes (CRT). It can be connected to the computer via VGA, DVI, HDMI, DisplayPort, 
						    Thunderbolt, LVDS (Low-voltage differential signaling) or other proprietary connectors 
						    and signals.<br/>
						    Originally, computer monitors were used for data processing while television receivers 
						    were used for entertainment. From the 1980s onwards, computers (and their monitors) have 
						    been used for both data processing and entertainment, while televisions have implemented 
						    some computer functionality. The common aspect ratio of televisions, and computer monitors, 
						    has changed from 4:3 to 16:10, to 16:9.<br/>

							<h4>Screen Size</h4>
							Clearly, a laptop with a 15.4″ diagonal screen is going to be physically larger than one 
							with a 14″ or 12″ or screen. The actual size of the laptop has been increased in order to 
							hold the larger screen. <br/>
							<b>Widescreen vs. Standard Aspect Ratio</b><br/>
							Although you can still find them here and there, standard aspect screens (4×3 aspect ratio) 
							are starting to disappear. That’s kind of a rip-off, as regular aspect ratio screens are 
							bigger than wide screens, with 16×9 ratios. Now that there’s a widescreen craze with big 
							TVs, the little screens are following, and we will probably be in an all-widescreen world 
							pretty soon; so, we won’t worry about it too much. The LCD makers have geared their factories 
							towards the wide screens, and that means cheaper wide screens.

							<h4>Screen resolution</h4>
							Resolution refers to the amount of pixels across by the amount of pixels up and down. Usually, 
							bigger screens mean bigger resolutions. Also, cheaper screens of the same size have less 
							resolution. You may want to upgrade to the “+” version of the screen you are thinking about 
							if you have good near vision. It will give you more room to move things around and you can see 
							more stuff at once. If you want to see big text, you may want to consider sticking with the 
							standard screen, or even looking for a cheaper model with a lower resolution. We are getting 
							closer to a time where font size and screen resolution won’t matter, but we aren’t there yet. 
							You may want to go and look at different screens at a local computer or electronics store to 
							figure out what size and resolution you like. As time goes on, larger screens keep getting 
							cheaper, and instead of increasing screen size too much laptop prices have come down. If you 
							are aiming for a very small notebook, you will most probably end up with a 12″ screen.<br/>
							Here’s a range of laptop screen sizes and the resolutions that are often displayed on the 
							screen. To give you an idea of how much you can see on the screen we include megapixel 
							values for each screen size:

						    Whether you're selling an idea, a project, a product, or even a job in your organization, 
						    you must enter that situation with an expert understanding of your audience, and of what 
						    they care about. So effective selling means lots of preparation, meaning that much of your 
						    work will come before your speak to the people you're selling to.<br/>
						    Follow these tips to help in your preparation process:<br/>
						    <ul>
						    	<li><b>Identify your target audience</b>– With whom will you speak? Is it your boss, 
						    	a key client, or your team? And is just one person involved in the purchase, or do you 
						    	need to influence other stakeholders in his or her organization?
						    	</li>
						    	<li><b>Identify key drivers</b>– You must understand what's driving your audience. For 
						    	instance, if your organization's goal is to increase profits by 10 percent this year, 
						    	how will your product/idea/project help them accomplish that goal?
						    	</li>
						    	<li><b>Identify the language that people use</b>– If you're addressing a technical 
						    	audience, be prepared to present using technical language and ideas. If you're selling 
						    	to finance people, use numbers and data to craft your message.
						    	</li>
						    	<li><b>Determine exactly what you're "selling"</b>– Is it a new feature that you want 
						    	added to the company's payroll process? A new product idea? A new reporting process for 
						    	your department's most important client? Identify what it is, and learn as much as you 
						    	can about it.
						    	</li>
						    	<li><b>Connect your audience and your product with benefits</b>– Great marketers and 
						    	salespeople understand that there's a distinct difference between features and benefits. 
						    	This is because your audience cares about only one thing: "What's in it for me?" So, it's 
						    	crucial to know the key differences:
						    		<ul>
						    			<li><b>Features </b>are what your product or idea does. For instance, the new 
						    			accounting software you want everyone to use is fast and easy, and it has real-time 
						    			reporting. These are the features of the software.</li>
						    			<li><b>Benefits </b>are what those features mean to your audience. For instance, 
						    			the accounting software's benefits are that people will have more time to do other 
						    			tasks, they'll be less stressed when they're using the program, and they'll get 
						    			up-to-date information from the system.</li>
						    		</ul><br/>
						        Features are boring, and people have to think quite hard to see the possibilities within 
						        them. But when you translate those features into benefits, you make an emotional connection 
						        with your audience.<br/>
						        When you're doing your pre-meeting preparation, focus on identifying the benefits of your 
						        idea or product, so that you can communicate that information to your audience.
						    	</li>
						    	<li><b>Understand the needs of your target audience</b>– Identify problems that your product 
						    	or idea will help solve, and needs that it will address. This will directly impact the way 
						    	you pitch, or sell, your idea. If you're speaking with people who are not in your industry, 
						    	make sure you use words and terms they can understand.
						    	</li>
						    	<li><b>Highlight your Unique Selling Proposition Add to My Personal Learning Plan (USP)</b> 
						    	– People buy the best possible solution that meets their needs and their budget. Make sure 
						    	that you highlight what makes your product, idea, or project uniquely relevant to them.
						    	</li>
						    </ul>

							Here are a few guidelines to follow during your pitch:<br/>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Have a conversation</b>
									 – You want to connect with your audience, so your presentation or pitch should feel more 
									 like a conversation. It may be unappealing to your audience – and to you – to get up in 
									 front of people and "sell" them something. But you can talk enthusiastically about an 
									 idea or product that you really believe in, and you can then discuss how it will help 
									 your audience.
								</li>
								<li><b>Ask questions</b>
									– Involving your audience is key to keeping them engaged. If you meet with someone 
									individually, like a client or your boss, then be sure to listen as much as you talk. 
									If you're presenting to a group, invite questions at key stages during the presentation.
								</li>
								<li><b>Focus on "helping" instead of "selling"</b>
									– Consultative selling means that you identify what your audience needs. Focus on these, 
									and keep your own goals and agenda out of the conversation.
								</li>
								<li><b>Watch body language</b>
									– Pay attention to everyone's <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/Body_Language.htm" target="_blank">
									body language</a> Add to My Personal Learning Plan during your 
									pitch. If people start to look bored or move their hands and feet a lot, then you need to 
									finish, or move onto the next part of your pitch.

							No matter what you're pitching, your audience will probably have some objections or reservations. 
							If you haven't prepared for this, then it may cause you to become frustrated and lose some control. 
							That's why knowing how to <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/ThinkingonYourFeet.htm" target="_balnk">
							think on your feet</a> Add to My Personal Learning Plan to overcome these objections is so important.<br/>

							It's helpful to realize that objections aren't a definite "no." They show that your audience is 
							willing to ask questions and state their concerns. So, objections are your opportunity to address 
							their fears, reassure them, and move forward positively.<br/>

							Whenever your audience presents an objection, you should ask questions. For instance, if your boss 
							says the new process you've created will be too expensive to implement right now, you may choose one 
							of these responses:

							<ol>
								<li>
									"It is expensive, but how much does it cost us each week to deal with this issue? And if we do 
									nothing, how much will it cost us over the next year?"
								</li>
								<li>
									"You're right, this will be an expensive process to implement company-wide. What if we start 
									with just one department to see how much it improves productivity?"
								</li>
							</ol><br/>
							When you approach objections with questions, it helps you find the real root of the issue. It also 
							shows your client or audience that you are aware of their concerns, and that you want to work with 
							them to find a solution.

							If you don't get a decision on the day, give your audience time to think about things. But don't leave 
							this open-ended. Your chances of a successful sale drop dramatically if you don't get some kind of 
							commitment from them.<br/>
							So, as you're finishing your pitch, set a specific date or time to speak with them again. This will

							gracefully. People rarely do this, so it may be a pleasant surprise to your audience, and they'll likely 
							be more receptive the next time you speak to them.
